# Lean list exercises
This repository contains my solutions for the 2nd homework of the Logic in Computer Science course at FMF UL.

The goal was to prove some properties of lists and vectors in the [Lean Theorem Prover](https://leanprover.github.io/).
All actual exercises are marked with comments (e.g. Exercise 1) and some comments contain additional notes. All of the remaining code, structures, comments,  and theorem formulations were done by the TA, I just filled in my solutions until the editor stopped screaming.
